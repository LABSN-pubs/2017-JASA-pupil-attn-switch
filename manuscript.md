abstract: Successful speech communication requires selective attention to a target stream in the presence of competing sounds. An objective physiological measure that reflected *where* attention was directed or *when* an attentional switch had occurred would be a useful tool for studying the mechanisms underlying selective auditory attention. Two experiments were conducted to determine whether the pupillary response is sensitive to auditory attention switches. In both experiments, pupil dilation, performance accuracy, and reaction time were measured during a task requiring listeners to either maintain or switch attention between two concurrent speech streams. Task difficulty was modulated in various ways to explore its effect on the pupillary response during attention switching tasks. In Experiment I, spectral degradation and switch gap duration were manipulated; in Experiment II, temporal degradation and target/masker gender match were manipulated. Deconvolved pupil responses revealed greater dilation on trials that required a switch of attention in comparison to trials that did not, demonstrating that the attentional switch is reflected in the pupillary response. Furthermore, while the stimulus manipulations had an effect on behavioral performance, the pupillary response continued to index only the top-down attentional task.

# Introduction
The ability to selectively attend to a target speech stream in the presence of competing sounds is required to communicate in everyday listening environments. This ability varies across individuals with normal hearing [@GoldbergEtAl2014], and for listeners with peripheral hearing deficits, changes in the encoding of stimuli often result in impaired selective attention and consequent difficulty communicating in noisy environments [@ShinnCunninghamBest2008].

Past findings show that directing auditory attention involves a complex interaction between endogenous control (conscious, top-down) and exogenous (re)orientation (involuntary, bottom-up) [@Carlyon2004; @ShammaEtAl2011].  Unfortunately, it is hard to tell which of two competing sounds a listener is attending to (other than through subjective report), making it difficult to segregate exogenous and endogenous aspects of attention experimentally. A physiological measure that could index the attended stimulus, or that could indicate when an attentional switch had occurred, would be a useful tool to complement psychophysical measures of auditory attention.

Pupillometry, the tracking of pupil diameter, has been used for over four decades to measure cognitive load [@KahnemanBeatty1966; @Beatty1982]. Pupil dilation is an involuntary, time-locked, externally-evoked physiological response that is present from infancy in humans and other animal species. In general, as the cognitive demands of a task increases, pupil dilation of up to about 5-6 mm can be observed up to 1 s after onset of relevant stimuli [@KahnemanBeatty1966; @Beatty1982; @HoeksLevelt1993]. While pupil dilation is slow (~1 Hz), recent results show that tracking of attention and cognitive processes with high temporal resolution (~10 Hz) is possible with deconvolution of the pupillary response [@WierdaEtAl2012; @McCloyEtAl2015].

Classic studies show that pupil dilation can be elicited with increases in cognitive load resulting from greater memory demands [@Taylor1981], sentence complexity [@AhernBeatty1981], or more difficult mathematical operations [@HessPolt1964]. In the auditory domain, changes in pupil dilation have been reported with decreased speech intelligibility [@ZekveldEtAl2010], different masker types [@KoelewijnEtAl2012], lexical properties of words  [@KuchinskyEtAl2007; @PapeshGoldinger2012], spectral degradation [@WinnEtAl2015], as well as the expected location, temporal onset and talker of a speech stream [@KoelewijnEtAl2015]. The pupillary response has also emerged as a measure of listening effort, which refers to “the mental exertion required to attend to, and understand, an auditory message” [@McGarrigleEtAl2014]. In this guise, pupillometry has been used in several studies to investigate the effects of age and hearing loss on listening effort [e.g., @ZekveldetAl2011; @KuchinskyEtAl2012].

Recent evidence suggests that the pupillary response is also sensitive to auditory attention [@KoelewijnEtAl2014; @KoelewijnEtAl2015]. When listeners are asked to divide their attention between two concurrent speech streams as opposed to attending to a single stream, a decrease in task performance is typically observed [@BestEtAl2010; @KoelewijnEtAl2014]; Koelewijn and colleagues (2014) additionally reported greater pupil dilation and later peak pupil latency when listeners were asked to attend to both speech streams present in the stimulus compared to attending to only one stream.

While there have been no previous pupillometry studies of attention switching, Larson and Lee [-@LarsonLee2013a] showed that when cueing listeners to maintain versus switch attention mid-trial regarding which of two letter streams to report, switching attention both reduced accuracy and led to longer response latency. The present study was designed to investigate whether the pupillary response is also sensitive to attention switches. Pupil dilation was measured while listeners heard two speech streams, with pre-trial cues instructing them to either switch attention from one stream to the other at a designated mid-trial gap, or to maintain attention on the same stream throughout the trial. Extrapolating from the divided attention results of Koelewijn and colleagues [-@KoelewijnEtAl2014], we predicted greater pupil dilation on trials that required attention switching.

# General Methods
All procedures were performed in a sound-treated booth; illumination was provided only by the LCD monitor that presented instructions, fixation points, etc. Auditory stimuli were sent via a TDT RP2 real-time processor (Tucker Davis Technologies, Alachula, FL) to Etymotic ER-2 insert earphones at a level of 65 dB SPL. Pupil size was measured continuously during each block of trials at a 1000 Hz sampling frequency using an EyeLink1000 infra-red eye tracker (SR Research, Kanata, ON). Participants’ heads were stabilized by a chin rest and forehead bar, fixing their eyes at a distance of 50 cm from the EyeLink camera. Accuracy and reaction time were also recorded for comparison with pupillometry data and the results of past studies.

# Experiment 1
In addition to the behavioral maintain-versus-switch manipulation, Experiment 1 included a stimulus manipulation known to cause variation in task demand: spectral resolution of the stimuli (implemented as variation in number of noise-vocoder bands). Based on results from Winn and colleagues [-@WinnEtAl2015] mentioned above, greater pupil dilation was expected in the 10-channel condition. Additionally, the duration of the mid-trial temporal gap provided for attentional switching was varied (either 200 ms or 600 ms). Behavioral and neuroimaging research by Larson and Lee [-@LarsonLee2013a; -@LarsonLee2013b] suggest that the time course of attention switching in the auditory domain is around 300-400 ms; accordingly, we expected the 200 ms switch gap to be the more challenging condition and thus predicted greater pupil dilation on short-gap trials.

## Methods
### Participants
Sixteen adults (eight female) aged 19 to 35 years (mean 25.5) participated in Experiment 1. All participants had normal audiometric thresholds (20 dB HL or better at octave frequencies from 250 Hz to 8 kHz), were compensated at an hourly rate, and gave informed consent to participate as overseen by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board.

### Stimuli
Stimuli were based on spoken alphabet letters ADEGOPUV from the ISOLET v1.3 corpus [@ColeEtAl1990] from one female and one male talker. Mean fundamental frequencies of the unprocessed recordings were 103 Hz (male talker) and 193 Hz (female talker). Letter durations ranged from 351 to 478 ms, and were silence-padded to a uniform duration of 500 ms, RMS normalized, and windowed at the edges with a 5 ms cosine-squared envelope. Two streams of four letters each were generated for each trial, with a gap of either 200 or 600 ms between the second and third letters of each stream.

Spectral degradation was implemented following a conventional noise vocoding strategy [@ShannonEtAl1995]. The stimuli were fourth-order bandpass filtered into 10 or 20 spectral bands of equal equivalent rectangular bandwidths [@MooreGlasberg1987]; the filterbank ranged from 200 Hz to 8000 Hz (low cutoff of the lowest filter to high cutoff of the highest filter). Each band was half-wave rectified and low-pass filtered with a 160 Hz fourth-order Butterworth filter to extract the amplitude envelope. The resulting amplitude envelopes were used to modulate white noise that had been bandpass filtered with the same filters used to extract the speech bands, and the resulting modulated noise bands were summed and presented diotically at 65 dB SPL. A white-noise masker with π-interaural-phase was played continuously during experimental blocks at a level of 45 dB SPL, yielding a stimulus-to-noise ratio of 20 dB. The additional noise was included to provide masking of environmental sounds (e.g., friction between subject clothing and earphone tubes) and to provide consistency with follow-up neuroimaging experiments (required due to the acoustic conditions in the neuroimaging suite).

### Procedure
Participants were instructed to maintain their gaze on a white fixation dot centered on a black screen throughout test blocks. Each trial began with a 1 s auditory cue (spoken letters “AA” or “AU”) indicating (by the sex of the talker) whether to attend first to the male or female voice, and additionally indicating whether to maintain attention to that talker throughout the trial (“AA” cue) or to switch attention to the other talker at the mid-trial gap (“AU” cue). The cue was followed by 0.5 s of silence, followed by the main portion of the trial: two concurrent, diotic 4-letter streams (one male voice, one female voice), with a variable-duration gap between the second and third letters. The task was to respond by button press to the letter “O” spoken by the target talker (Figure 2). To allow unambiguous attribution of button presses, the letter “O” was always separated from another “O” (in either stream) by at least 1 s, and its position in the letter sequence was balanced across trials and conditions.<!-- TODO: copied verbatim from EL paper -->

![(Color online) Illustration of trial types in Experiment 1. In the depicted “switch” trial (heavy dashed line), listeners would hear cue “AU” in a male voice, attend to the male voice (“EO”) for the first half of the trial and the female voice (“EU”) for the second half of the trial, and respond once (to the “O” occurring at 2–2.5 s). In the depicted “maintain” trial (heavy solid line), listeners would hear cue “AA” in a male voice, attend to the male voice (“EOPO”) throughout the trial, and respond twice (once for each “O”).](fig-1.eps)<!-- TODO: copied verbatim from EL paper -->

Before starting the experimental task, there were 2 blocks of 10 trials where participants listened to the stimuli. In the first block, participants heard the two talker streams together and in the second block, a single talker was separated out. Next, there was a training phase, which consisted of 3 blocks of 10 trials where participants learned the task. In the first training block, all trials were from the MAINTAIN condition where the target remained in the same stream. In the second training block, all trials were from the SWITCH condition where the target was in the other stream after the gap. In the last training block, the MAINTAIN and SWITCH conditions were randomized, as in test blocks. To pass the training phase, participants were required to reach 50% correct on the first two blocks and 40% correct on the third block. If participants did not reach the pass criteria, the training block was repeated. The three conditions for each trial (SWITCH vs. MAINTAIN, 10-CHANNEL vs. 20-CHANNEL, 200 ms vs. 600 ms GAP) were counterbalanced and randomly presented in 10 blocks of 32 trials, for a total of 320 trials.

### Behavioral analysis
Listener responses were labeled as “hits” if the button press occurred <!-- TODO: verify this next bit, esp. the "onset" part -->within 1 s of the onset of the “O” stimulus in the target stream. Responses at any other time during the trial (including responses in the 1 s window following “O” stimuli in the masker stream) were labeled as “false alarms”.

### Analysis of pupil diameter
Pupil diameter data for each trial were epoched from -0.5 s to 6 s, with 0 s being the onset of the pre-trial cue. Periods where eye blinks were detected by the EyeLink 1000 parser were linearly interpolated from 25 ms before the blink to 100 ms after. The data were then down-sampled from 1000 Hz to 20 Hz because there was little energy at frequencies above 10 Hz in both the raw pupil diameter recordings and the computed pupil response kernel. To assess the effect of switching attention on pupil dilation, <!-- TODO: verify this next bit -->only data for responses in the third letter position immediately after the gap was analyzed.

Analysis of pupil diameter was done using normalized values, calculated by subtracting the mean dilation during baseline (the period from -0.5 s to 0 s on each trial) and dividing by the standard deviation of pupil dilation over the course of the experiment. In addition, analyses were carried out on the normalized pupil diameter time series data after deconvolution with a pupil response kernel (Hoeks and Levelt, 1993; Wierda et al 2012). This method is similar to analyses routinely used in fMRI studies to determine the BOLD response. Briefly, the input to a linear system is assumed to be a train of impulses of potentially varying amplitudes, which, when convolved with a fixed impulse response function (the pupil response kernel), yields the observed pupil dilation time series. Using this model, one can estimate the timing and magnitude of the input (impulse train) by deconvolution of the output (pupil diameter time series) with the pupil response kernel. In this case, rather than performing true deconvolution, estimated the magnitude of the input pulses by modeling the measured pupil diameter time series as a linear combination of pupil response kernels (one at each time sample). Since the pupil response kernel is by definition an impulse response, the coefficients of the linear model are equivalent to estimates of the magnitudes of the input pulses.

<!-- TODO: fix refs and equations -->
Following Hoeks and Levelt (1993) and Wierda and colleagues (2012), we modeled the pupil response kernel as an Erlang gamma function, "h=s∙" ("t" ^"n"  )"∙" e^(((-nt)/tmax) ),  with scaling factor s, time t, and empirically determined parameters n (the number of “layers” in the cascade of upstream neural events leading to the pupillary change) and tmax (the time of maximal response from an isolated impulse). Hoeks and Levelt experimentally estimated n = 10.1 and tmax = 930 ms. However, they only analyzed data from trials involving button-press responses, which may have impacted their estimate of tmax due to effects of the preparatory motor response on pupil dilation (Hupé et al 2009). Consequently, we performed an auxilliary experiment to estimate tmax in our own lab, with a paradigm more similar to our main experiments (i.e., auditory stimuli without rapid button-press responses).  This auxiliary experiment is described further in the Appendix; it yielded a smaller estimate of tmax = 512 ms, which we used in our model of the pupil response kernel.

## Results
### Pupillometry
Mean pupil response as a function of time split by attention, spectral channels, and gap duration trials are shown in Figure 2. It appears that greater pupil dilation was seen on SWITCH compared to MAINTAIN trials and on 600 ms GAP compared to 200 ms GAP trials but not on 10-CHANNEL compared to 20-CHANNEL trials. Pairwise contrasts were performed for all three main contrasts to generate multiple-comparisons corrected family-wise error rate (FWER) p-values through temporal clustering with maximal statistics. This confirmed that switching attention evoked significantly greater pupil dilation (p<0.001) for both normalized and deconvolved pupil responses. Furthermore, this increase in dilation was observed soon after the auditory switch cue was presented (t = 1 s), prior to the switch gap when the attentional switch actually occurred. Finally, greater dilation was also observed later in the trial (p=0.009 normalized, p=0.005 deconvolved) with the longer 600 ms GAP duration.

The onset of the auditory cue (“AA” or “AB”) is at 0 s with a 500 ms gap before the onset of the letter streams. \label{fig-2}](figures/fig-placeholder.eps)

### Sensitivity analysis
Mean performance across conditions is shown in Figure 3, with accuracy on the left and reaction time on the right. As expected, overall accuracy appears greater on MAINTAIN versus SWITCH trials and 20-CHANNEL versus 10-CHANNEL trials. Longer reaction times were also observed on SWITCH, 10-CHANNEL, and the 200 ms GAP trials. Two repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) with attention, spectral channels, and gap duration as factors were conducted for d-prime and reaction time. For d-prime, the RMANOVA revealed a significant main effect of switching attention (F(1,15)=11.21, p=0.004) and the number of vocoder channels (F(1,15)=16.25, p=0.001), with no significant interactions. This analysis confirmed that performance accuracy captured the increased difficulty associated with switching attention as well as with spectral degradation. For reaction time, the RMANOVA also revealed a significant main effect of switching attention (F(1,15)=13.96, p=0.002) and number of vocoder channels (F(1,15)=38.89, p<0.001). However, an additional significant main effect of gap duration (F(1,15)=7.029, p=0.018) and a significant interaction between switching attention and gap duration (F(1,15)=4.910, p=0.043), consistent with the fact that gap duration only matters when a switch is required was also observed.

## Discussion
The results of this experiment demonstrate that pupil dilation is a sensitive measure for the switching of attention. For both normalized and deconvolved pupil responses, greater pupil dilation was seen on SWITCH trials compared to MAINTAIN trials. An unexpected finding was that no difference in pupil response was observed between the 20-CHANNEL versus 10-CHANNEL vocoded trials, which were predicted to affect pupil dilation. These results are inconsistent with the results of Winn et al. (2014), which found increased pupil dilation as the spectral resolution of speech decreased. One difference between Winn et al. and this current study is that the participants were instructed to perform a top-down attentional switch task. A possible reason for these results is that sensitivity of the pupil response to the explicit top-down task overrode the effect of the bottom-up manipulations of spectral resolution and switch gap duration. To further investigate, a second experiment with additional stimulus manipulations was conducted.

# Experiment 2
<!-- TODO: add some intro text -->
## Methods
### Participants
Sixteen adults (XXX female) aged 18 to 35 years (mean XXX) were recruited for experiment 2. All participants had normal audiometric thresholds (20 dB HL or better at octave frequencies from 250 Hz to 8 kHz) and were compensated at an hourly rate. All participants gave informed consent to participate as overseen by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board.

### Stimuli and procedure <!-- TODO: split into separate sections -->
Two new stimulus manipulations were investigated in Experiment II.  First, temporal degradation was introduced by adding reverberation to the letter streams. The same original natural speech tokens were used from Experiment I. Binaural room impulse responses (BRIR) measured in an ordinary classroom from Shinn-Cunningham et al. (2005) were used to create a REVERBERANT and an ANACHOIC listening environment. The reverberant condition was generated with the BRIRs measured from the corner of the classroom with a source distance of 0.15 m and source azimuth of 45°. The anechoic condition was generated with the BRIRs measured from the center location removed of all reverberant energy by time-windowing the BRIRs to include only the portion with the direct impulse response. Further details regarding the two listening environments can be found in Shinn-Cunningham et al. (2005).

Second, the effect of male versus female masker was investigated by varying the talker in the masker stream. In experiment 2, the target stream was always the male speaker. In the MALE-MALE trials, the masker stream was also the same male speaker and in the MALE-FEMALE trials, the masker stream was the female speaker. These three conditions for each trial (SWITCH vs. MAINTAIN, REVERBERANT vs. ANACHOIC, and MALE-MALE vs. MALE-FEMALE) were counterbalanced and randomly presented in 10 blocks of 32 trials for a total of 320 trials. All other aspects of testing including the listening and training phases were the same as in experiment 1.

## Results
### Pupillometry
Mean pupil response as a function of time split by attention, reverberation, and male versus female masker trials are shown in Figure 4. Pairwise contrasts were performed for all three main contrasts to generate multiple-comparisons corrected FWER p-values as in Experiment I. This confirmed that significantly greater pupil dilation (p<0.001) was also seen on SWITCH trials for both normalized and deconvolved pupil responses. This increase in dilation was observed soon after the auditory switch cue was presented (t = 1 s). Finally, greater pupil dilation was also observed later in the trial (t= 4s) in the REVERBERANT trials (p=0.038), only with the deconvolved pupil responses.

### Sensitivity analysis
Mean performance across conditions is shown in Figure 5, with accuracy on the left and reaction time on the right. As expected, decreased accuracy and increased reaction times was seen on the SWITCH trials. Overall accuracy also appears greater in the ANECHOIC versus the REVERVERANT trials. Two RMANOVAs with attention, reverberation and male vs. female masker as factors were conducted for d-prime and reaction time. For d-prime, the RMANOVA revealed a significant main effect of switching attention (F(1,15)=11.20, p=0.004) and reverberation (F(1,15)=16.25, p=0.001), with no significant interactions. This analysis confirmed that performance accuracy reflected the increased difficulty associated with switching attention as well as with reverberation. For reaction time, the RMANOVA revealed only a significant main effect of reverberation (F(1,15)=11.88, p=0.004) and no significant interaction. Neither d-prime nor reaction time was affected by having a male-male versus male-female target-masker combination.

# General discussion
The primary question addressed in this study was whether pupil dilation could serve as a useful physiological measure in investigations of auditory attention. The results of both Experiment I and II demonstrate that greater pupil dilation is observed on trials that required the switching of attention. The increase in dilation started shortly after the auditory cue to switch was presented and was consistent with task performance measures. Decreased accuracy on the letter recognition task was seen on switch trials in Experiment I and II and reaction time was also longer in Experiment I. Additional bottom-up stimulus manipulations which included spectral and temporal degradation, switch gap duration, and whether it was a male-male or male-female target-masker combination did not affect the amount of pupil dilation observed during this top-down attentional task.

That the pupillary response is sensitive to the switching of auditory attention is consistent with past studies showing that it reflects cognitive load during tasks involving language, memory, and attentional processing. It is also consistent with the results of Koelewijn et al. (2014), which found that the dividing of auditory attention results in greater pupil dilation. However, an important aspect of whether pupil dilation would be a useful measure is whether it provides information beyond accuracy and reaction time. In studies of speech perception, pupillometry has been shown to add a fuller characterization of listening effort, especially when task performance is high. Winn et al. (2015) demonstrated that although intelligibility on a sentence perception task was at ceiling, listening effort as measured by pupil dilation, continued to vary with spectral resolution. Similarly, in Kuchinsky et al. (2011) the interaction between signal-to-noise ratio and lexical competition was seen in the pupillary response, even in trials that were correct.

In this current study, pupil dilation revealed information on the time course of the attentional switch that was not captured by task performance. On switch trials, pupil dilation started shortly after the auditory cue was presented, well before the actual attentional switch occurred. This suggests that listeners were preparing and listening differently from the start of the switch trials and not only during the attentional switch. Larson and Lee (2013a) found behavioral evidence of this preparatory phase on a similar task where listeners were required to maintain or switch attention between two streams of 6 letters. Performance was worse on switch trials, even when the target letter occurred before the switch gap. The pupillometry data from this study is consistent with the behavioral evidence from Larson and Lee (2013a) and further illustrates the time course by showing the divergence of the pupil trace on switch trials following the auditory cue at the start of the trial.

Another potential application for pupillometry in studies of auditory attention would be to help tease apart exogenous and endogenous influences on the ability to selectively attend to one stream or another. Two bottom-up stimulus manipulations that influenced task demand were introduced in each experiment. In Experiment I, increased pupil dilation was predicted on trials with greater spectral degradation and shorter switch gap duration, regardless of whether listeners were required to switch or maintain attention. However, this was not observed in the results of Experiment I. To further confirm this finding, the task was repeated with two different bottom-up stimulus manipulations in Experiment II. Greater pupil dilation was predicted with reverberation and a male-male target-masker combination. Once again, no difference in pupillary response was observed on these trials despite the fact that the bottom-up manipulations created “hard” and “easy” trials, which were expected to influence pupil dilation. In both experiments, the pupillary response continued to track the attentional task.

While the effect of many of these manipulations on pupil dilation have not been previously studied, this unexpected finding is inconsistent with the results of Winn et al. (2015) showing a systematic increase in pupil dilation with the decrease in spectral resolution of speech stimuli. A similar vocoding strategy was used in Experiment I of Winn et al. and this current study but Winn et al. had 5 vocoder conditions (Normal, 32, 16, 8, and 4 channels) as opposed to the two in this study (10 and 20 channels). One possibility for why greater pupil dilation was not observed in this study may be that the difference between the 10 and 20 channels was not enough to elicit a change in pupil diameter. Another related possibility is that 10 channels still provided sufficient spectral information for the letter recognition task so pupil dilation was not affected (Shannon et al., 1995). However, the results of Winn et al. show that increased pupil dilation is observed even with 16 and 32 channels. Furthermore, lower d-prime and longer reaction times were seen on the 10 versus 20 channel trials suggesting that a perceptual difference in the two vocoder conditions does exist. As the relationship between how much pupil dilation should be expected with how much spectral degradation is unknown, it is difficult to further assess these reasons.

Another possible factor is that the pupillary responses in this study were recorded in a completely darkened booth in front of a black computer screen with no additional sources of light. Baseline pupillary dilation in these conditions would be on the higher end of each subject’s pupil dilation range. It is possible that calibrating the luminance of the computer screen to elicit pupil dilation at the midpoint of each subject’s dilation range during baseline might increase the sensitivity of the pupillary response to small changes in spectral resolution such as presented in this current study (Winn et al., 2015).

Finally, it is also possible that the top-down attentional task overrode the sensitivity of the pupillary response to bottom-up stimulus differences. The participants were given explicit instructions to either maintain or switch attention while performing the letter recognition task. For this reason, the pupillary response may have continued to track attention but not the bottom-up stimulus differences. If this were the case, pupillometry has the potential to be sensitive to either top-down or bottom-up differences, which would greatly facilitate investigations of the relationship between exogenous and endogenous attention. Carefully designed studies that differentiate between top-down and bottom-up factors are needed to further investigate this possibility.

The two methods employed to analyze the pupillary responses in this study was modeled after Wierda et al. (2012). Pupil responses were normalized with reference to baseline dilation and also deconvolved with the pupil response function. Deconvolution of the pupillary response is suggested to have greater physiological relevance and statistical sensitivity (Hoeks and Levelt, 1993). Wierda et al. also showed that tracking of attentional pulses with high temporal resolution is possible with deconvolution of the pupillary response. In this present study however, only small differences in the two analysis methods were observed. In Experiment II, deconvolution of the pupillary response revealed a marginally significant difference (p=0.038) in dilation on reverberant trials that was not seen in the normalized pupil responses. Nevertheless, because target letters were presented at a relatively slow rate (seconds) compared to in Wierda et al. (300 ms), it is possible that the benefits of deconvolution were not seen with this paradigm. Further comparison of pupillometry analysis methods including growth curve analysis (Winn et al. 2015, Kuchinsky et al. 2011), deconvolution (Wierda et al. 2012, Hoeks and Levelt, 1993), as well as more traditional measures of mean and peak pupil dilation (Zekveld et al., 2011; Zekveld et al., 2013) should be investigated in future studies to determine optimal analysis methods for different experimental paradigms.

Many foundational studies have now been conducted in the auditory domain demonstrating that the pupillary response is sensitive to listening effort during speech perception (Koelewijn et al. 2012; Zekveld et al. 2010) and to both the switching and dividing of auditory attention (Koelewijn et al., 2014; Koelewijn et al. 2015). The potential for clinical application with older adults with hearing loss (Kuchinsky et al., 2011; Zekveld et al., 2011; Koelewijn et al. 2014) and users of cochlear implants (Winn et al., 2015) has also been demonstrated. The next phase of studies are required to further establish the parameters of applying pupillometry to auditory investigations. While this current study shows evidence that pupil dilation can be used to indicate when a switch in attention has occurred, many questions remain for further study.

Pupillometry has been used in many studies as a physiological measure of cognitive load. By increasing task demands that involve language, short-term memory, attention or other higher-level cognitive abilities such as math, an increase in pupil diameter is observed. A fundamental question that remains is how each of these cognitive processes can be differentiated from the overall cognitive load. This understanding is critical for investigations looking at the neural mechanisms of auditory attention that may be less relevant for those motivated clinically. If pupil dilation is elicited through the addition of language or memory demands as opposed to attention, different neural networks will be recruited. A general framework to define the relationship between cognitive load, listening effort, language, working memory, and auditory attention would be a good starting point to guide future studies. Finally, further investigations of the underlying physiology of the pupillary response, especially as elicited by auditory attention are also a priority.
