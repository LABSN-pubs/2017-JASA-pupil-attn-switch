abstract: Successful speech communication often requires selective attention to a target stream in the presence of competing sounds, as well as the ability to switch attention among multiple interlocutors. An objective physiological measure that reflected *where* attention was directed or *when* an attentional switch had occurred would be a useful tool for studying the mechanisms underlying selective auditory attention. Two experiments were conducted to determine whether the pupillary response is sensitive to auditory attention switches. In both experiments, pupil dilation, performance accuracy, and reaction time were measured during a task requiring listeners to either maintain or switch attention between two concurrent speech streams. Task difficulty was modulated in various ways to explore its effect on the pupillary response during attention switching tasks. In Experiment 1, spatially distinct stimuli were manipulated by simulating reverberation (affecting the integrity of temporal segregation cues), and target/masker gender match was also manipulated.  In Experiment 2, non-spatial stimuli were manipulated by spectral degradation and altering the duration of the mid-trial switch gap. Pupil responses showed greater dilation on trials requiring switching attention between talkers, demonstrating that the attentional switch is reflected in the pupillary response. Furthermore, while the stimulus manipulations had an effect on behavioral performance, the pupillary response was affected only by the top-down attentional task.

# Introduction
The ability to selectively attend to a target speech stream in the presence of
competing sounds is required to communicate in everyday listening environments.
This ability varies across individuals with normal hearing,[@GoldbergEtAl2014]
For listeners with peripheral hearing deficits, changes in the encoding of
stimuli often result in impaired selective attention and consequent difficulty
communicating in noisy environments.[@ShinnCunninghamBest2008]

Past findings show that directing auditory attention involves a complex
interaction between endogenous control (conscious, top-down) and exogenous
(re)orientation (involuntary, bottom-up).[@Carlyon2004; @ShammaEtAl2011]
Unfortunately, it is hard to tell which of two competing sounds a listener is
attending to (other than through subjective report), making it difficult to
experimentally segregate exogenous and endogenous aspects of attention. A
physiological measure that could index the attended stimulus, or that could
indicate when an attentional switch had occurred, would be a useful tool to
complement psychophysical measures of auditory attention.

Pupillometry, the tracking of pupil diameter, has been used for over four
decades to measure cognitive load.[@KahnemanBeatty1966; @Beatty1982]  Pupil
dilation is an involuntary, time-locked, externally-evoked physiological
response that is present from infancy in humans and other animal species. In
general, as the cognitive demands of a task increases, pupil dilation of up to
about 5-6 mm can be observed up to 1 second after onset of relevant
stimuli.[@KahnemanBeatty1966; @Beatty1982; @HoeksLevelt1993]  While pupil
dilation is slow (~1 Hz), recent results show that tracking of attention and
cognitive processes with high temporal resolution (~10 Hz) is possible with
deconvolution of the pupillary response.[@WierdaEtAl2012; @McCloyEtAl2016]

Classic studies show that pupil dilation can be elicited with increases in
cognitive load resulting from greater memory demands,[@Taylor1981] sentence
complexity,[@AhernBeatty1981] or more difficult mathematical
operations.[@HessPolt1964]  In the auditory domain, changes in pupil dilation
have been reported with decreased speech intelligibility,[@ZekveldEtAl2010]
different masker types [@KoelewijnEtAl2012], lexical properties of
words,[@PapeshGoldinger2012] spectral degradation,[@WinnEtAl2015] as well as
the expected location, temporal onset and talker of a speech
stream.[@KoelewijnEtAl2015]  The pupillary response has also emerged as a
measure of listening effort, which refers to “the mental exertion required to
attend to, and understand, an auditory message”.[@McGarrigleEtAl2014]  In this
guise, pupillometry has been used in several studies to investigate the effects
of age and hearing loss on listening effort.[@ZekveldEtAl2011;
@KuchinskyEtAl2013; @WinnEtAl2015]

Recent evidence suggests that the pupillary response is also sensitive to
auditory attention.[@KoelewijnEtAl2014; @KoelewijnEtAl2015]  When listeners are
asked to divide their attention between two concurrent speech streams as
opposed to attending to a single stream, a decrease in task performance is
typically observed;[@BestEtAl2010; @KoelewijnEtAl2014] Koelewijn and colleagues
additionally reported greater pupil dilation and later peak pupil latency when
listeners were asked to attend to both speech streams present in the stimulus
compared to attending to only one stream.[@KoelewijnEtAl2014]

While there have been no previous pupillometry studies of attention switching,
Larson and Lee[@LarsonLee2013a] showed that when cueing listeners in a target
detection task to either maintain attention to one stream or switch attention
to the other stream mid-trial, switching attention both reduced accuracy and
led to longer response latency. The present study was designed to investigate
whether the pupillary response is also sensitive to attention switches. Pupil
dilation was measured while listeners heard two speech streams, with pre-trial
cues instructing them to either switch attention from one stream to the other
at a designated mid-trial gap, or to maintain attention on the same stream
throughout the trial. Extrapolating from the divided attention results of
Koelewijn and colleagues,[@KoelewijnEtAl2014] we predicted greater pupil
dilation on trials that required attention switching.

# General Methods
All procedures were performed in a sound-treated booth; illumination was
provided only by the LCD monitor that presented instructions and fixation
points. Auditory stimuli were sent via a TDT RP2 real-time processor (Tucker
Davis Technologies, Alachula, FL) to Etymotic ER-2 insert earphones at a level
of 65 dB SPL. Pupil size was measured continuously during each block of trials
at a 1000 Hz sampling frequency using an EyeLink1000 infra-red eye tracker (SR
Research, Kanata, ON). Participants’ heads were stabilized by a chin rest and
forehead bar, fixing their eyes at a distance of 50 cm from the EyeLink camera.
Target detection accuracy and response time were also recorded for comparison
with pupillometry data and the results of past studies.

# Experiment 1
In addition to the behavioral maintain-versus-switch manipulation, Experiment 1
included a cued stimulus manipulation expected to cause variation in task demand:
temporal resolution of the stimuli (implemented as presence/absence of simulated
reverberation). Greater pupil dilation was expected in the reverberant condition.
Additionally, the gender of the competing talker was varied (either the same male
voice as the target talker, or a female voice, uncued). <!-- TODO: mention
release from masking due to talker dissimilarity, expectation of smaller dilation
in MF condition. -->

## Methods
### Participants
Sixteen adults (ten female) aged 21 to 35 years (mean 25.1) participated in
Experiment 1. All participants had normal audiometric thresholds (20 dB HL or
better at octave frequencies from 250 Hz to 8 kHz), were compensated at an
hourly rate, and gave informed consent to participate as overseen by the
University of Washington Institutional Review Board.

### Stimuli
Stimuli were based on spoken alphabet letters ABIJKMOQRUXY from the ISOLET v1.3
corpus[@ColeEtAl1990] from one female and one male talker. Mean fundamental
frequencies of the unprocessed recordings were 103 Hz (male talker) and 193 Hz
(female talker). Letter durations ranged from 351 to 478 ms, and were
silence-padded to a uniform duration of 500 ms, RMS normalized, and windowed at
the edges with a 5 ms cosine-squared envelope. Two streams of four letters each
were generated for each trial, with a gap of 600 ms between the
second and third letters of each stream. The letters “A” and “B” were used only
in the pre-trial cues (described below); the target letter was “O” and letters
“IJKMQRUXY” were non-target items.  To allow unambiguous attribution of button
presses, the letter “O” was always separated from another “O” (in either
stream) by at least 1 second; thus there were between zero and two “O” tokens
per trial.  The position of “O” tokens in the letter sequence was
balanced across trials and conditions, with XX% of all “O” tokens occuring in
the third letter slot (just after the switch gap, since that slot is most
likely to be affected by attention switches). <!-- TODO: fill in percentage
of doping the 3rd slot. -->

Reverberation was implemented using binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs)
recorded by Shinn-Cunningham and colleagues.[@ShinnCunninghamEtAl2005] Briefly,
an “anechoic” condition was created by processing the stimuli with BRIRs
truncated to include only the direct impulse response and exclude reverberant
energy, while stimuli for the “reverberant” condition were processed with the
full BRIRs. In both conditions, the BRIRs recorded at ±45° for each stream were
used, simulating a separation of 90° azimuth between target and masker streams.
A white-noise masker with π-interaural-phase was played continuously during
experimental blocks at a level of 45 dB SPL, yielding a stimulus-to-noise ratio
of 20 dB. The additional noise was included to provide masking of environmental
sounds (e.g., friction between subject clothing and earphone tubes) and to
provide consistency with follow-up neuroimaging experiments (required due to
the acoustic conditions in the neuroimaging suite).

### Procedure
Participants were instructed to fixate on a white dot centered on a black
screen and maintain such gaze throughout test blocks. Each trial began with a 1
second auditory cue (spoken letters “AA” or “AB”); the cue was always in a male
voice, and its spatial location indicated to attend first to the male talker at
that location. The letters spoken in the cue indicated whether to maintain
attention to the cue talker’s location throughout the trial (“AA” cue) or to
switch attention to the other talker at the mid-trial gap (“AB” cue). The cue
was followed by 0.5 s of silence, followed by the main portion of the trial:
two concurrent 4-letter streams with simulated spatial separation (either the
same male voice in both streams, or one male and one female voice), with a 600
ms gap between the second and third letters. The task was to respond by button
press to the letter “O” spoken by the target talker (Figure
\ref{fig-rev-trial-diagram}).

![(Color online) Illustration of “maintain” and “switch” trial types in Experiment 1. In the depicted “switch” trial (heavy dashed line), listeners would hear cue “AB” in a male voice, attend to the male voice (“QU”) for the first half of the trial and the female voice (“OM”) for the second half of the trial, and respond once (to the “O” occurring at 3.1–3.6 seconds). In the depicted “maintain” trial (heavy solid line), listeners would hear cue “AA” in a male voice, attend to the male voice (“QUJR”) throughout the trial, and not respond at all.\label{fig-rev-trial-diagram}](fig-trial-rev.eps)

Before starting the experimental task, participants heard 2 blocks of 10 trials
for familiarization with anechoic and reverberant speech (one with a single
talker, one with two simultaneous talkers). Next, listeners did 3 training
blocks of 10 trials each (one block of “maintain” trials, one block of “switch”
trials, and one block of randomly mixed “maintain” and “switch” trials).
Training blocks were repeated until participants achieved ≥50% of trials
correct on the homogenous blocks and ≥40% of trials correct on the mixed block.
During testing, the three experimental conditions (maintain/switch,
anechoic/reverberant speech, and male-male versus male-female talker
combinations) were counterbalanced and randomly presented in 10 blocks of 32
trials each, for a total of 320 trials.

### Behavioral analysis
Listener responses were labeled as “hits” if the button press occurred between
100 and 1000 ms after the onset of “O” stimuli in the target stream. Responses
at any other time during the trial were considered “false alarms”. False alarm
responses occurring between 100 and 1000 ms following the onset of “O” stimuli
in the *masker stream* were additionally labeled as “responses to foils” to aid
in assessing failures to selectively attend to the target stream.

In both experiments, response accuracy and latency were analyzed with
(generalized) linear mixed-effects regression models, using `afex` version
`0.16.1`[@afex] and `lme4`[@BatesEtAl2015] version `1.1.12` in the `R`
statistical computing environment.[@R3.3.1]  A model for listener sensitivity
was constructed to predict probability of button press at each timing slot of
the trial (one timing slot per stimulus letter), given fixed-effect predictors
specifying trial parameters (maintain/switch, anechoic/reverberant, and gender
match/mismatch) and a random intercept estimated for each listener.  An inverse
probit link function was used to transform button press probabilities (bounded
between 0 and 1) into unbounded continuous values suitable for linear modeling.
The general form of this model is given in (@eq-mod-probit), where $\Phi^{-1}$
is the inverse probit link function, $Pr(Y = 1)$ is the probability of button
press, $X$ is the design matrix of trial parameters, and $\beta$ is the vector
of parameter coefficients to be estimated.  <!-- TODO: add crossref to
supplementary -->

(@eq-mod-probit)  $\Phi^{-1}(Pr(Y = 1 \mid X)) = X^\prime \beta$

This model has the convenient advantage that coefficient estimates are
interpretable as differences in $d^\prime$ between different experimental
conditions.[@DeCarlo1998; @SheuEtAl2008; @McCloyLee2015]  Reaction time was
analyzed using linear mixed-effects regression (i.e., without a link function)
but was otherwise similar to the analysis of response accuracy / sensitivity.
Significance of predictors in the reaction time model was computed using
F-tests and the Kenward-Roger approximation for degrees of freedom;
significance in the sensitivity model was determined by likelihood ratio tests
between models with and without the predictor of interest (as the Kenward-Roger
approximation has not been demonstrated to work with non-normally-distributed
response variables, i.e., when modeling probabilities).

### Analysis of pupil diameter
Recordings of pupil diameter for each trial were epoched from −0.5 to 6 seconds,
with 0 seconds defined as the onset of the pre-trial cue. Periods where eye
blinks were detected by the EyeLink software were linearly interpolated from
25 ms before blink onset to 100 ms after blink offset. Epochs were normalized
by subtracting the mean pupil size between −0.5 and 0 seconds on each trial, and
dividing by the standard deviation of pupil size across all trials.

Normalized pupil size data were then deconvolved with a pupil impulse response
kernel.[@WierdaEtAl2012; @McCloyEtAl2016]  Briefly, the pupil response kernel
represents the stereotypical time course of a pupillary response to an isolated
stimulus, modeled as an Erlang gamma function with empirically-determined
parameters $t_\mathrm{max}$ (latency of response maximum) and $n$ (Erlang shape
parameter).[@HoeksLevelt1993]  The parameters used here were
$t_\mathrm{max}=0.512 s$ and $n=10.1$ following previous
literature.[@McCloyEtAl2016]  

Fourier analysis of the subject-level mean pupil size data and the
deconvolution kernel indicated virtually no energy at frequencies above 3 Hz,
so for computational efficiency the deconvolution was realized as a best-fit
linear sum of kernels spaced at 100 ms intervals (similar to downsampling both
signal and kernel to 10 Hz prior to deconvolution), as implemented in the
pyeparse software.[@pyeparse]  After deconvolution, the resulting time series
can be thought of as an indicator of listener arousal or effort that is
time-aligned to the stimulus (i.e., the response latency of the pupil has been
effectively removed).  Statistical comparison of effort (i.e., deconvolved
pupil dilation) time series was performed using a non-parametric cluster-level
one-sample T-test on the within-subject differences in deconvolved pupil size
between experimental conditions (clustering across time
only),[@MarisOostenveld2007], as implemented in
`mne-python`.[@GramfortEtAl2013]

## Results

### Pupillometry
Mean effort as a function of time for the three stimulus manipulations
(reverberant/anechoic trials, talker gender match/mismatch trials, and
maintain/switch attention trials) are shown in Figure \ref{fig-rev-pupil}. Only
the attentional manipulation shows a significant difference between conditions,
with “switch attention” trials showing greater effort than “maintain attention”
trials, diverging as soon as listeners have heard the cue and remaining higher
throughout the rest of the trial.

## Discussion
***TODO: polish this text.*** all main effects significant and in expected
direction for sensitivity.  Only attention is significant for reaction time.
There is a significant interaction between reverberation and talker gender
(mis)match that is expected: when both talkers are male, the difference between
anechoic and reverberant performance is bigger (i.e., reverberation hurts more
when both talkers are male).  No interactions were seen in the reaction time
data.

***TODO: polish this text.*** The pupillary response was only sensitive to
attention condition.  This may be because, for normal hearing listeners,
reverberation is not a serious enough degradation to really cause extra effort
or load (even though there is a small performance hit).

# Experiment 2
Since no effect of talker gender on pupil dilation was seen in Experiment 1, in
Experiment 2 the target and masker talkers were always of opposite gender, and
their status as target or masker was counterbalanced across trials. Since no
effect of reverberation on pupillary response was seen in Experiment 1,
Experiment 2 also removed the simulated spatial separation of talkers and
involved a more severe cued stimulus degradation known to cause variation in
task demand: spectral degradation (implemented as variation in number of
noise-vocoder bands, 10 or 20).  Based on results from Winn and
colleagues[@WinnEtAl2015] mentioned above, greater pupil dilation was expected
in the (lower-intelligibility) 10-channel condition. The cued behavioral
maintain-versus-switch manipulation from Experiment 1 was retained in
Experiment 2, and additionally, the duration of the mid-trial temporal gap
provided for attentional switching was varied (either 200 ms or 600 ms,
uncued). Behavioral and neuroimaging research by Larson and Lee suggest that
the time course of attention switching in the auditory domain is around 300-400
ms;[@LarsonLee2013a; @LarsonLee2013b] accordingly, we expected the 200 ms
switch gap to be the more challenging condition and thus predicted greater
pupil dilation on short-gap trials.

## Methods
### Participants
Sixteen adults (eight female) aged 19 to 35 years (mean 25.5) participated in
Experiment 1. All participants had normal audiometric thresholds (20 dB HL or
better at octave frequencies from 250 Hz to 8 kHz), were compensated at an
hourly rate, and gave informed consent to participate as overseen by the
University of Washington Institutional Review Board.

### Stimuli
Stimuli were based on spoken alphabet letters ADEGOPUV from the ISOLET v1.3
corpus[@ColeEtAl1990] from the same female and male talkers used in Experiment
1, with the same stimulus preprocessing steps (padding, loudness normalization,
and edge windowing).  Two streams of four letters each were generated for each
trial, with a gap of either 200 or 600 ms between the second and third letters
of each stream. The letters “A” and “U” were used only in the pre-trial cues
(described below); the target letter was “O” and letters “DEGPV” were
non-target items.  The cue and non-target letters differed from those used in
Experiment 1 in order to maintain good discriminability of letters even under
the most degraded (10-channel vocoder) condition.

Spectral degradation was implemented following a conventional noise vocoding
strategy.[@ShannonEtAl1995]  The stimuli were fourth-order bandpass filtered
into 10 or 20 spectral bands of equal equivalent rectangular
bandwidths;[@MooreGlasberg1987] the filterbank ranged from 200 Hz to 8000 Hz
(low cutoff of the lowest filter to high cutoff of the highest filter). Each
band was half-wave rectified and low-pass filtered with a 160 Hz fourth-order
Butterworth filter to extract the amplitude envelope. The resulting amplitude
envelopes were used to modulate white noise that had been bandpass filtered
with the same filters used to extract the speech bands, and the resulting
modulated noise bands were summed and presented diotically at 65 dB SPL.  A
simultaneous white-noise masker was presented as in Experiment 1.

### Procedure
Participants were instructed to fixate on a white dot centered on a black
screen and maintain such gaze throughout test blocks. Each trial began with a 1
second auditory cue (spoken letters “AA” or “AU”); the gender of the cue’s
talker indicated whether to attend first to the male or female voice, and
additionally indicating whether to maintain attention to that talker throughout
the trial (“AA” cue) or to switch attention to the other talker at the
mid-trial gap (“AU” cue). The cue was followed by 0.5 s of silence, followed by
the main portion of the trial: two concurrent, diotic 4-letter streams (one
male voice, one female voice), with a variable-duration gap between the second
and third letters. The task was to respond by button press to the letter “O”
spoken by the target talker (Figure \ref{fig-voc-trial-diagram}). To allow
unambiguous attribution of button presses, the letter “O” was always separated
from another “O” (in either stream) by at least 1 second, and its position in
the letter sequence was balanced across trials and conditions.

![(Color online) Illustration of “maintain” and “switch” trial types in Experiment 2. In the depicted “switch” trial (heavy dashed line), listeners would hear cue “AU” in a male voice, attend to the male voice (“EO”) for the first half of the trial and the female voice (“DE”) for the second half of the trial, and respond once (to the “O” occurring at 2–2.5 seconds). In the depicted “maintain” trial (heavy solid line), listeners would hear cue “AA” in a male voice, attend to the male voice (“EOPO”) throughout the trial, and respond twice (once for each “O”).\label{fig-voc-trial-diagram}](fig-trial-voc.eps)

Before starting the experimental task, participants heard 2 blocks of 10 trials
for familiarization with noise-vocoded speech (one with a single talker, one
with the two simultaneous talkers). Next, they did 3 training blocks of 10
trials each (one block of “maintain” trials, one block of “switch” trials, and
one block of randomly mixed “maintain” and “switch” trials). Training blocks
were repeated until participants achieved ≥50% of trials correct on the
homogenous blocks and ≥40% of trials correct on the mixed block. During
testing, the three experimental conditions (maintain/switch, 10/20 channel
vocoder, and 200/600 ms gap duration) were counterbalanced and randomly
presented in 10 blocks of 32 trials each, for a total of 320 trials.

### Behavioral analysis
As in Experiment 1, listener responses were labeled as “hits” if the button
press occurred between 100 and 1000 ms of the onset of “O” stimuli in the
target stream, other responses were considered “false alarms”, and false alarms
occurring between 100 and 1000 ms after an “O” onset in the *masker stream*
were labeled as “responses to foils”.  Statistical modeling of sensitivity and
reaction time used the same approach as was used in Experiment 1.

### Analysis of pupil diameter
Analysis of pupil diameter was carried out as in Experiment 1: trials epoched
from -0.5 to 6 seconds, linear interpolation of eye blinks, trial-wise baseline
subtraction and experiment-wise division by standard deviation of pupil size.
Deconvolution and statistical analysis of normalized pupil size data was also
carried out identically to Experiment 1.

## Results
### Pupillometry
***TODO: this section not yet edited***  
Mean pupil response as a function of time split by attention, spectral channels,
and gap duration trials are shown in Figure \ref{fig-voc-pupil}. It appears that greater pupil
dilation was seen on SWITCH compared to MAINTAIN trials and on 600 ms GAP
compared to 200 ms GAP trials but not on 10-CHANNEL compared to 20-CHANNEL
trials. Pairwise contrasts were performed for all three main contrasts to
generate multiple-comparisons corrected family-wise error rate (FWER) p-values
through temporal clustering with maximal statistics. This confirmed that
switching attention evoked significantly greater pupil dilation (p<0.001) for
both normalized and deconvolved pupil responses. Furthermore, this increase in
dilation was observed soon after the auditory switch cue was presented (t = 1
s), prior to the switch gap when the attentional switch actually occurred.
Finally, greater dilation was also observed later in the trial (p=0.009
normalized, p=0.005 deconvolved) with the longer 600 ms GAP duration.

Hatched region shows temporal span of statistically significant differences between time series. The divergence in (b) is attributable to the delay of stimulus presentation in the long-gap condition; the onset of divergence in (c) aligns with the end of the cue, as in Experiment 1 (see Fig. \ref{fig-rev-pupil}c). a.u. = arbitrary units (deconvolution procedure yields “kernel weights” at each time point, which are interpretable as listener effort).\label{fig-voc-pupil}](pupil-fig-voc.eps)

### Sensitivity analysis
Mean performance across conditions is shown in Figure \ref{fig-voc-dprime},
with accuracy on the
left and reaction time on the right. As expected, overall accuracy appears
greater on MAINTAIN versus SWITCH trials and 20-CHANNEL versus 10-CHANNEL
trials. Longer reaction times were also observed on SWITCH, 10-CHANNEL, and the
200 ms GAP trials. Two repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) with
attention, spectral channels, and gap duration as factors were conducted for
d-prime and reaction time. For d-prime, the RMANOVA revealed a significant main
effect of switching attention (F(1,15)=11.21, p=0.004) and the number of vocoder
channels (F(1,15)=16.25, p=0.001), with no significant interactions. This
analysis confirmed that performance accuracy captured the increased difficulty
associated with switching attention as well as with spectral degradation. For
reaction time, the RMANOVA also revealed a significant main effect of switching
attention (F(1,15)=13.96, p=0.002) and number of vocoder channels
(F(1,15)=38.89, p<0.001). However, an additional significant main effect of gap
duration (F(1,15)=7.029, p=0.018) and a significant interaction between
switching attention and gap duration (F(1,15)=4.910, p=0.043), consistent with
the fact that gap duration only matters when a switch is required was also
observed.

## Discussion
The results of this experiment demonstrate that pupil dilation is a sensitive
measure for the switching of attention. For both normalized and deconvolved
pupil responses, greater pupil dilation was seen on SWITCH trials compared to
MAINTAIN trials. An unexpected finding was that no difference in pupil response
was observed between the 20-CHANNEL versus 10-CHANNEL vocoded trials, which were
predicted to affect pupil dilation. These results are inconsistent with the
results of Winn et al. (2014), which found increased pupil dilation as the
spectral resolution of speech decreased. One difference between Winn et al. and
this current study is that the participants were instructed to perform a
top-down attentional switch task. A possible reason for these results is that
sensitivity of the pupil response to the explicit top-down task overrode the
effect of the bottom-up manipulations of spectral resolution and switch gap
duration. To further investigate, a second experiment with additional stimulus
manipulations was conducted.

# General discussion
The primary question addressed in this study was whether pupil dilation could
serve as a useful physiological measure in investigations of auditory attention.
The results of both Experiment I and II demonstrate that greater pupil dilation
is observed on trials that required the switching of attention. The increase in
dilation started shortly after the auditory cue to switch was presented and was
consistent with task performance measures. Decreased accuracy on the letter
recognition task was seen on switch trials in Experiment I and II and reaction
time was also longer in Experiment I. Additional bottom-up stimulus
manipulations which included spectral and temporal degradation, switch gap
duration, and whether it was a male-male or male-female target-masker
combination did not affect the amount of pupil dilation observed during this
top-down attentional task.

That the pupillary response is sensitive to the switching of auditory attention
is consistent with past studies showing that it reflects cognitive load during
tasks involving language, memory, and attentional processing. It is also
consistent with the results of Koelewijn et al. (2014), which found that the
dividing of auditory attention results in greater pupil dilation. However, an
important aspect of whether pupil dilation would be a useful measure is whether
it provides information beyond accuracy and reaction time. In studies of speech
perception, pupillometry has been shown to add a fuller characterization of
listening effort, especially when task performance is high. Winn et al. (2015)
demonstrated that although intelligibility on a sentence perception task was at
ceiling, listening effort as measured by pupil dilation, continued to vary with
spectral resolution. Similarly, in Kuchinsky et al. (2011) the interaction
between signal-to-noise ratio and lexical competition was seen in the pupillary
response, even in trials that were correct.

In this current study, pupil dilation revealed information on the time course of
the attentional switch that was not captured by task performance. On switch
trials, pupil dilation started shortly after the auditory cue was presented,
well before the actual attentional switch occurred. This suggests that listeners
were preparing and listening differently from the start of the switch trials and
not only during the attentional switch. Larson and Lee (2013a) found behavioral
evidence of this preparatory phase on a similar task where listeners were
required to maintain or switch attention between two streams of 6 letters.
Performance was worse on switch trials, even when the target letter occurred
before the switch gap. The pupillometry data from this study is consistent with
the behavioral evidence from Larson and Lee (2013a) and further illustrates the
time course by showing the divergence of the pupil trace on switch trials
following the auditory cue at the start of the trial.

Another potential application for pupillometry in studies of auditory attention
would be to help tease apart exogenous and endogenous influences on the ability
to selectively attend to one stream or another. Two bottom-up stimulus
manipulations that influenced task demand were introduced in each experiment. In
Experiment I, increased pupil dilation was predicted on trials with greater
spectral degradation and shorter switch gap duration, regardless of whether
listeners were required to switch or maintain attention. However, this was not
observed in the results of Experiment I. To further confirm this finding, the
task was repeated with two different bottom-up stimulus manipulations in
Experiment II. Greater pupil dilation was predicted with reverberation and a
male-male target-masker combination. Once again, no difference in pupillary
response was observed on these trials despite the fact that the bottom-up
manipulations created “hard” and “easy” trials, which were expected to influence
pupil dilation. In both experiments, the pupillary response continued to track
the attentional task.

While the effect of many of these manipulations on pupil dilation have not been
previously studied, this unexpected finding is inconsistent with the results of
Winn et al. (2015) showing a systematic increase in pupil dilation with the
decrease in spectral resolution of speech stimuli. A similar vocoding strategy
was used in Experiment I of Winn et al. and this current study but Winn et al.
had 5 vocoder conditions (Normal, 32, 16, 8, and 4 channels) as opposed to the
two in this study (10 and 20 channels). One possibility for why greater pupil
dilation was not observed in this study may be that the difference between the
10 and 20 channels was not enough to elicit a change in pupil diameter. Another
related possibility is that 10 channels still provided sufficient spectral
information for the letter recognition task so pupil dilation was not affected
(Shannon et al., 1995). However, the results of Winn et al. show that increased
pupil dilation is observed even with 16 and 32 channels. Furthermore, lower
d-prime and longer reaction times were seen on the 10 versus 20 channel trials
suggesting that a perceptual difference in the two vocoder conditions does
exist. As the relationship between how much pupil dilation should be expected
with how much spectral degradation is unknown, it is difficult to further assess
these reasons.

Another possible factor is that the pupillary responses in this study were
recorded in a completely darkened booth in front of a black computer screen with
no additional sources of light. Baseline pupillary dilation in these conditions
would be on the higher end of each subject’s pupil dilation range. It is
possible that calibrating the luminance of the computer screen to elicit pupil
dilation at the midpoint of each subject’s dilation range during baseline might
increase the sensitivity of the pupillary response to small changes in spectral
resolution such as presented in this current study (Winn et al., 2015).

Finally, it is also possible that the top-down attentional task overrode the
sensitivity of the pupillary response to bottom-up stimulus differences. The
participants were given explicit instructions to either maintain or switch
attention while performing the letter recognition task. For this reason, the
pupillary response may have continued to track attention but not the bottom-up
stimulus differences. If this were the case, pupillometry has the potential to
be sensitive to either top-down or bottom-up differences, which would greatly
facilitate investigations of the relationship between exogenous and endogenous
attention. Carefully designed studies that differentiate between top-down and
bottom-up factors are needed to further investigate this possibility.

The two methods employed to analyze the pupillary responses in this study was
modeled after Wierda et al. (2012). Pupil responses were normalized with
reference to baseline dilation and also deconvolved with the pupil response
function. Deconvolution of the pupillary response is suggested to have greater
physiological relevance and statistical sensitivity (Hoeks and Levelt, 1993).
Wierda et al. also showed that tracking of attentional pulses with high temporal
resolution is possible with deconvolution of the pupillary response. In this
present study however, only small differences in the two analysis methods were
observed. In Experiment II, deconvolution of the pupillary response revealed a
marginally significant difference (p=0.038) in dilation on reverberant trials
that was not seen in the normalized pupil responses. Nevertheless, because
target letters were presented at a relatively slow rate (seconds) compared to in
Wierda et al. (300 ms), it is possible that the benefits of deconvolution were
not seen with this paradigm. Further comparison of pupillometry analysis methods
including growth curve analysis (Winn et al. 2015, Kuchinsky et al. 2011),
deconvolution (Wierda et al. 2012, Hoeks and Levelt, 1993), as well as more
traditional measures of mean and peak pupil dilation (Zekveld et al., 2011;
Zekveld et al., 2013) should be investigated in future studies to determine
optimal analysis methods for different experimental paradigms.

Many foundational studies have now been conducted in the auditory domain
demonstrating that the pupillary response is sensitive to listening effort
during speech perception (Koelewijn et al. 2012; Zekveld et al. 2010) and to
both the switching and dividing of auditory attention (Koelewijn et al., 2014;
Koelewijn et al. 2015). The potential for clinical application with older adults
with hearing loss (Kuchinsky et al., 2011; Zekveld et al., 2011; Koelewijn et
al. 2014) and users of cochlear implants (Winn et al., 2015) has also been
demonstrated. The next phase of studies are required to further establish the
parameters of applying pupillometry to auditory investigations. While this
current study shows evidence that pupil dilation can be used to indicate when a
switch in attention has occurred, many questions remain for further study.

Pupillometry has been used in many studies as a physiological measure of
cognitive load. By increasing task demands that involve language, short-term
memory, attention or other higher-level cognitive abilities such as math, an
increase in pupil diameter is observed. A fundamental question that remains is
how each of these cognitive processes can be differentiated from the overall
cognitive load. This understanding is critical for investigations looking at the
neural mechanisms of auditory attention that may be less relevant for those
motivated clinically. If pupil dilation is elicited through the addition of
language or memory demands as opposed to attention, different neural networks
will be recruited. A general framework to define the relationship between
cognitive load, listening effort, language, working memory, and auditory
attention would be a good starting point to guide future studies. Finally,
further investigations of the underlying physiology of the pupillary response,
especially as elicited by auditory attention are also a priority.
