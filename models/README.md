Here, `dfs.RData` is a repackaging of the raw data to make loading/looping
easier. The final models reported in the paper are in `lrt-models.RData` (for
sensitivity) and `rt-models.RData` (for reaction time), with model summaries
written to the various text files.  Those models are generated by
`../run-models.sh`.  The statistics done on the pupillometric measurements are
done in python, in the scripts `../figures/fig-pupil-*.py`.
